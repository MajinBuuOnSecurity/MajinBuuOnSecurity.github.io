title: "[WIP] Softtop Scenarios"
---

What if we combine the ideas of
- [@badthingsdaily](https://twitter.com/badthingsdaily?lang=en) a public feed of Tabletop Scenarios 
- [What happens when...](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) 

but instead of a technical interview question and various security incident scenarios, we focus on soft skills instead?

Give an example of a critical people situation, or office politics -- in the security space -- and then solicit the security community to crowdsource advice and best practices?

This can help folks 'level up' their soft skills without needing to:
- Read any self-congratulatory 'thought leader wannabe' type LinkedIn posts
- Sort though various disparate resources and Slack conversations
- Read traditional resources and try to map those to security-specific scenarios all by themselves
- Fear attribution when asking others about sensitive topics / situations
- Listen to (certain) security leaders on podcasts or YouTube who love to hear themselves talk
- Run into a stupid Medium paywall or Substack paid subscription wall

Using a bottom line up front approach and always attributing / mapping approaches used to traditional resources, for consistent terminology and frameworks -- with a bias towards popular resources rather than obscure ones, written over verbal.

# Topics

"Soft Skills" is pretty broad.

Let us limit this primarily through the lenses of:
- Influence / Persuasion / "Buy-in"
- Communication

That way it will be just as helpful to ICs as it is to leaders.

# Scenario Criteria

These scenarios should be situations to fit a STAR answer for the following question: "Tell me about a time that you [convinced/influenced/pursuaded] others to achieve a security objective?"

Concrete Situations that may be brought up, in an answer, to this, but asked more directly could be:
- "How do you run a vulnerability management program?"
- "How did you build a 'security champions' program at your last company?"



# Security or Tech Industry Resources

The A Life Engineered guy has a video about how bad STAR is, and what to do instead, titled "[Don't Get Down-Leveled or How to Tell a Good Story (From a Principal at Amazon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU6BVxtGd5g)".


Here is a transcript so you can see it in writing instead of verbally.

TODO

37 minutes Flee talk

Unlike traditional resources, these should 

If you reference a resource, you should still summarize the concept you are referencing, so that readers don't need to watch a 40 minutes Bsides talk or buy a book.



Talks suck.

Publicly, Writing > Talking

You must have heard a million of these basics:
- "Being a gatekeeper is bad"
- "Get to yes, rather than just say No"
- "Don't be the department of No"
- "Shaming people for falling for phishing is bad"

I agree with these.. but they are banal true-isms, if you've worked in the industry 6 months, you've heard all these.

Understand and manage


- "Security is everyone's responsibility, not everyone's job"
- "Give away your legos"
- "Build pave roads / secure defaults"

Setup processes

Publish SLAs
Sunlight is a great disinfectant
Identify patterns in vulnerabilities

Risk registries
Present/Summarize Risks

The data is the data









# Traditional Resources

This is not a list of soft skill books, so much as it is a list of resources that were referenced in an answer to one of softtop scenarios.
