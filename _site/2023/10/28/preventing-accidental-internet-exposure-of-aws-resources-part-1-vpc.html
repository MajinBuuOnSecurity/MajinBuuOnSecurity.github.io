    <p><a href="https://github.com/ramimac/aws-customer-security-incidents#background">Many AWS customers have suffered breaches</a> due to exposing resources to the Internet by accident, resources that an attacker can find via traditional public IP network scanning or <a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/how-to-hack-an-airline/">searching Shodan</a>. This three-part series walks through different ways to mitigate that risk.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-problem">About The Problem</h2>

<p>There are many ways to make resources public in AWS. <a href="https://github.com/SummitRoute/aws_exposable_resources#aws-exposable-resources">github.com/SummitRoute/aws_exposable_resources</a> was created specifically to maintain a list of all AWS resources that can be publicly exposed and how.</p>

<p>This post discusses preventing public network access for resources exclusively in a VPC (EC2 instances, ELBs, RDS databases, etc.).</p>

<p>Ideally, you can look at your AWS organization structure from a 1000-foot view and know which subtree of accounts / OUs can have publicly accessible VPCs.</p>

<p>What Good Looks Like:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cVFUpkJ.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2 id="solving-the-problem">Solving The Problem</h2>

<p>You can implement this by banning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ec2:CreateInternetGateway"</code> in subaccounts via SCP.<sup id="fnref:2111" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2111" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason this works is because although there are many ways an accidental Internet-exposure might happen – for VPCs at least – every way requires an Internet Gateway (IGW). E.g.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1e4M8z4.gif" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Or:     <br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gyXZz2E.gif" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>With IGWs banned, you can hand subaccounts over to customers, and they will never be able to make public-facing load balancers or EC2 instances regardless of their IAM permissions!</p>

<p>There is only one complication with this.</p>

<p>In AWS: <ins>Egress to the Internet is tightly coupled with Ingress from the Internet</ins>. In most cases, only the former is required (for example, downloading libraries, patches, or OS updates).</p>

<p>They are tightly coupled because both require an Internet Gateway (IGW).</p>

<p>The Egress use-case typically looks like:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vKsdNOh.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2 id="supporting-egress-in-private-vpc-accounts">Supporting Egress in Private VPC Accounts</h2>

<p>To support the Egress use-case, you must ensure your network architecture tightly couples NAT with an Internet Gateway by, e.g., giving subaccounts a paved path to a NAT Gateway in another account. You can do this via:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#option-1-centralized-egress-via-transit-gateway-tgw">Centralized Egress via Transit Gateway (TGW)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-2-centralized-egress-via-privatelink-or-vpc-peering-with-egress-filtering">Centralized Egress via PrivateLink (or VPC Peering) with Egress Filtering</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-3-vpc-sharing">VPC Sharing</a></li>
  <li><a href="#option-4-ipv6-for-egress">IPv6 for Egress</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully, one of these options will align with the goals of your networking team.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to go with TGW for most accounts, and VPC Sharing for sandbox accounts. Once you are ready to implement Egress Filtering, use PrivateLink + Egress Filtering.</p>

<h3 id="option-1-centralized-egress-via-transit-gateway-tgw">Option 1: Centralized Egress via Transit Gateway (TGW)</h3>

<p>This is the most common implementation, and probably the best. If money is no issue for you: go this route.</p>

<p>It looks like this:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/alRH2hN.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>AWS first wrote about this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/creating-a-single-internet-exit-point-from-multiple-vpcs-using-aws-transit-gateway/">in 2019</a> and lists it under their prescriptive guidance as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/centralized-egress.html">Centralized Egress</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, each VPC in a subaccount has a route table with 0.0.0.0/0 destined traffic sent to a TGW in another account, where an IGW does live.</p>

<h4 id="a-note-on-cost">A Note On Cost</h4>

<p>This will reduce your NAT Gateway cost, which is arguably the most notoriously expensive networking component in AWS.</p>

<p>On one hand, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/centralized-egress-to-internet.html">AWS states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deploying a NAT gateway in every AZ of every spoke VPC can become cost-prohibitive because you pay an hourly charge for every NAT gateway you deploy, so centralizing could be a viable option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, they also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some edge cases, when you send huge amounts of data through a NAT gateway from a VPC, keeping the NAT local in the VPC to avoid the Transit Gateway data processing charge might be a more cost-effective option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending huge amounts of data through a NAT Gateway should be avoided anyway.
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html">S3</a>, <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/platform/announcing-aws-privatelink-support-on-splunk-cloud-platform.html">Splunk</a>, <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/integrations/aws/aws-privatelink/">Honeycomb</a>, and similar companies<sup id="fnref:1350" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1350" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> have VPC endpoints you can utilize to lower NAT Gateway data processing charges.</p>

<p>The following is a graph, <a href="https://gist.github.com/MajinBuuOnSecurity/361a0bac8e65432a567d5d157d2524d5">generated with Python</a>. As you can see at e.g. 20 VPCs you’d need to be sending over 55 TB for centralized egress to be more expensive, it only gets more worthwhile the more VPCs you add.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fxKEToY.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>See <a href="#can-you-walk-through-the-cost-details-around-option-1">the FAQ</a> for a verbose example.</p>

<h3 id="option-2-centralized-egress-via-privatelink-or-vpc-peering-with-egress-filtering">Option 2: Centralized Egress via PrivateLink (or VPC Peering) with Egress Filtering</h3>

<p>PrivateLink and VPC Peering are mostly non-options. See the <a href="#why-is-vpc-peering-not-a-straightforward-option">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>

<p>However, if you are willing to do a lot of heavy lifting that is orthogonal to AWS primitives, you <em>can</em> use these in combination with <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/internet-egress-filtering-of-services-at-lyft-72e99e29a4d9">Internet Egress Filtering</a>, to accomplish centralized egress. This is because the destination IP of outbound traffic won’t be the Internet, but a private IP.</p>

<p>This is assuming you are deploying e.g. iptables, to re-route Internet-destined traffic on every host.</p>

<p>Some reasons you may not want to do this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Significant effort</li>
  <li>It won’t be possible for all subaccount types, such as sandbox accounts. (Where requiring <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> and a proxy are too heavyweight.)</li>
  <li>Egress filtering is lower-priority than preventing accidental Internet-exposure. So tightly coupling the two and needing to setup a proxy first may not make strategic sense.</li>
  <li>If something goes wrong on the host, the lost traffic will not appear in VPC flow logs <sup id="fnref:98" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or traffic mirroring logs.<sup id="fnref:985" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:985" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> The DNS lookups will show up in Route53 query logs, but that’s it.</li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, AWS does not have a primitive to perform Egress filtering,<sup id="fnref:99" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> so you will eventually have to implement Egress filtering via a proxy. Therefore, in e.g. production accounts, you can go with this option.</p>

<p>Using PrivateLink, in this way, would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vg9rcTE.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Note that not a single NAT Gateway is necessary here, as Envoy is running in an public subnet.</p>

<h3 id="option-3-vpc-sharing">Option 3: VPC Sharing</h3>

<p>This is a tempting, simple option, that is not well known.<sup id="fnref:996" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:996" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>You can simply make a VPC in your networking account, and share private subnets to subaccounts.</p>

<p>This looks like:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4OojfzP.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The main problem with this approach, is that there will <em>still be an Internet Gateway in the VPC</em>.</p>

<p>Being limited to private subnets helps with 2 problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Engineers can launch EC2 instances and you won’t have to worry about them implicitly getting a public IP address.</li>
  <li>Engineers can create Load Balancers, but never Internet-facing ones. As <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CreateLoadBalancer</code> requires that a public subnet be provided.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, an engineer can still make Internet-facing assets with e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Global Accelerator</li>
  <li>Any future services that treat the presence of an IGW as a welcome mat</li>
</ul>

<p>I will discuss addressing the risk of these services more in the <a href="https://majinbuuonsecurity.github.io/2023/10/28/preventing-accidental-internet-exposure-of-aws-resources-part-2-handling-all-services.html">next part</a> of the series.</p>

<h4 id="why-a-public-ip-in-a-private-subnet-is-not-concerning">Why a public IP in a private subnet is not concerning</h4>

<p>TODO: IF YOU HAVE A VPC WITHOUT AN IGW, CAN YOU GIVE A PUBLIC IP VIA <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AssociatePublicIpAddress</code> OR EIP? It shouldn’t work I would think, nothing to do static NAT.</p>

<p>An engineer can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ec2:RunInstances</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ec2:AssociatePublicIpAddress</code> condition key set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"true"</code>, or through associating an EIP with an instance. Both of these actions should be blocked <a href="https://github.com/ScaleSec/terraform_aws_scp/blob/521ac29d712a6ebb51feb6f11b56e6c40b61bada/security_controls_scp/modules/ec2/deny_public_ec2_ip.tf#L5-L29">via SCP</a>.</p>

<p>However, it is interesting to note, that it wouldn’t be too severe if it happened.</p>

<p>If an EC2 is in a private subnet, in a VPC with an IGW, and has a public IP, you can send packets to it from the Internet. Fortunely the EC2 can’t really respond.</p>

<p>This is because the route table that a subnet is associated with is only checked on outgoing traffic, not incoming traffic.</p>

<p>As for why it cannot respond to traffic. For a private subnet, the route table will have a path to a NAT Gateway, so response packets will have the source IP of the NAT Gateway rather than the EC2 instance.<sup id="fnref:9133" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9133" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>TODO: GET MY NMAP SCREENSHOTS</p>

<p>TODO: TEST THIS AGAIN, THE 2ND PART, NOT THE 1ST</p>

<p>TODO: Also do ifconfig test</p>

<h4 id="why-a-nacl-cannot-help">Why a NACL Cannot Help</h4>

<p>You might think that, since NACLs support to deny rules, you could add an Ingress deny rule blocking the Internet from hitting the EC2s in the private subnet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because NACLs are stateless, Egress traffic to the Internet would have all responses blocked by the NACL.</p>

<h4 id="a-strategic-implication-of-vpc-sharing">A Strategic Implication of VPC Sharing</h4>

<p>In the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html#shareable-vpc">Shareable AWS Resources</a> page of the AWS RAM documentation, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ec2:Subnet</code> is one of 7 resource types marked as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can share with <strong><em>only</em></strong> AWS accounts in its own organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means you can never perform an AWS organization migration in the future.</p>

<p>If you are like most AWS customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Management Account of your AWS Organization has most of your resources in it</li>
  <li>You want to follow Best Practices<sup id="fnref:996221" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:996221" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> and have an empty Management Account</li>
  <li>It is infeasible to ‘empty’ out the current management account over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you will need to perform an org migration in the future, and should stay away from VPC Sharing.</p>

<p>However, suppose you are willing to risk a production outage 😂 (Particularly if you do not use ASGs or Load Balancers, which will lose access to the subnets.) The NAT Gateway will remain functional according to AWS.</p>

<p>See</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scenario 5: VPC Sharing across multiple accounts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/migrating-accounts-between-aws-organizations-from-a-network-perspective/">Migrating accounts between AWS Organizations, a network perspective</a> by Tedy Tirtawidjaja for more information.</p>

<h3 id="option-4-ipv6-for-egress">Option 4: IPv6 for Egress</h3>

<p>Remember how I said, “in AWS: Egress to the Internet is tightly coupled with Ingress from the Internet” above. For IPv6, that’s a lie.</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses are globally unique and, therefore, public by default. Due to this, AWS created the primitive of an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.html">Egress-only Internet Gateway</a>,</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with this primitive, there is no way to connect IPv4-only destinations, so if that is necessary – which it likely is – go with one of the other 3 options.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wtuaa71.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h4 id="more-details-around-ipv4-only-destinations">More details around IPv4-only Destinations</h4>

<p>As Sébastien Stormacq wrote in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/let-your-ipv6-only-workloads-connect-to-ipv4-services/">Let Your IPv6-only Workloads Connect to IPv4 Services</a>, you need only add a route table entry and set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--enable-dns64</code> on subnets to accomplish this – but you unfortunately still need an IGW.</p>

<p>DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in subnets will then return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations with the well-known <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">64:ff9b::/96</code> prefix. And due to the route table entry, traffic with that prefix will be sent to the NAT Gateway.</p>

<p>The problem is the NAT Gateway then needs an IGW to communicate with the destination, so one of the <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/IPv6-reference-architectures-for-AWS-and-hybrid-networks-ra.pdf">other options</a> becomes necessary.</p>

  <p>For 1 NAT Gateway: $0.045 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/">per hour</a>. They are also AZ-specific. So that is 3 availability zones * <a href="https://techoverflow.net/2022/12/21/how-many-hours-are-there-in-each-month/">730.48</a> hours in a month * $0.045 = $98.61 per month per VPC.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s say you have 100 VPCs, split across a variety of different accounts/regions etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is $9,861 a month, or $118,332 annually!</p>

  <p>For NAT Gateway: $0.045 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/">per GB data processed</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s say you have 100 GB a month, that is just $4.50 per month.</p>

  <p>1 TB a month would be $45.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-vpc-peering-not-a-straightforward-option">Why is VPC peering not a straightforward option?</h3>

<p>The short answer is that VPC peering is not transitive, so it is not designed for you to be able to ‘hop’ through an IGW via it. If you change your VPC route table to send Internet-destined traffic to a VPC peering connection, the traffic won’t pass through.</p>

<p>AWS lists this under <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations">VPC peering limitations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>If VPC A has an internet gateway, resources in VPC B can’t use the internet gateway in VPC A to access the Internet.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>If VPC A has a NAT device that provides Internet access to subnets in VPC A, resources in VPC B can’t use the NAT device in VPC A to access the Internet.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1625r2h/comment/jxxodvl">longer explanation is</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AWS has specific design principles and limitations for VPC peering to ensure security and network integrity. One of these limitations is that edge-to-edge routing is not supported over VPC peering connections. VPC connections are specifically designed to be non-transitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means resources in one VPC cannot access the Internet via an internet gateway or a NAT device in a peer VPC. AWS does not propagate packets destined for the Internet from one VPC to another over a peering connection, even if you try configuring NAT at the instance level.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary reason for this limitation is to maintain a clear network boundary and enforce security policies. If AWS allowed traffic from VPC B to Egress to the Internet through VPC A’s NAT gateway, it would essentially make VPC A a transit VPC, which breaks the AWS design principle of VPC peering as a non-transitive relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-is-vpc-privatelink-not-a-straightforward-option">Why is VPC PrivateLink not a straightforward option?</h3>

<p>The reasoning is similar to peering: PrivateLink is not meant to be transitive.</p>

<p>To dive deeper: When you make an interface VPC endpoint with AWS PrivateLink, a “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requester-managed-eni.html">requester-managed network interface</a>” is created. The “requester” is AWS, as you can see by the mysterious “727180483921” account ID.</p>

<p>If you try to disable “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#eni-basics">Source/destination checking</a>” (which ensures that the ENI is either the source or the destination of any traffic it receives), you will not be able to. So traffic is dropped before it would ever travel cross-account.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-cheaper-is-vpc-sharing-than-tgw">How much cheaper is VPC Sharing than TGW?</h3>

<p><em>Assuming you would have 50 spoke VPCs and were in US East.</em></p>

<p>If you are making 1 giant VPC, and sharing different subnets to each subaccount. Each option would have 1 NAT Gateway, so in that way they are the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 Transit Gateway: with (50 + 1) VPC attachments, at 0.05 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/pricing/">per hour</a>. 51 * 730.48 * 0.05  = $1,862.72 per month.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At $0.02 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/pricing/">per GB data processed</a>, that is 20 bucks a month more per TB of data!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming 1 TB of data processed a month, that is $1,882.72 more a month.</p>

<h4 id="vpc-endpoint-costs">VPC Endpoint Costs</h4>

<p>If you wanted to use VPC endpoints across all VPCs, then you’d have to pay 50x more for them with TGW.</p>

<p>Those are $0.01 per hour per availability zone = $22 per month per service per VPC. So for e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQS, SNS, KMS, STS, X-Ray, ECR, ECS</code> across all VPCs that is $154 a month with sharing.</p>

<p>Vs $7,700 a month with 50 separate VPCs!</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-access-my-machines-if-they-are-all-in-private-subnets">How do I access my machines if they are all in private subnets?</h3>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html">SSM</a>, or a similar product.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Are there no VPC flow logs for traffic that gets dropped due to a source/destination check on an ENI?</li>
  <li>If there are no VPC flow logs for traffic, there won’t be any possibility of mirroring that traffic either, right?</li>
  <li>Are there any other options for Egress that I missed?</li>
  <li>Did I get anything wrong? I’m sure the Internet will let me know in spades.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Let me know how it goes limiting your Internet-exposed attack surface in an easy to understand, secure-by-default way.</p>

<p>You might still get breached, but hopefully in a more interesting way.</p>
