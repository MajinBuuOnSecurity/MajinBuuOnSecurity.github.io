<p>8/10</p>

<p>This doesn’t improve soft skills much.</p>

<h3 id="managers-path">Manager’s Path</h3>

<p>6/10</p>

<p>I think this book mostly sucks.</p>

<h3 id="minto-pyramid-principle">Minto Pyramid Principle</h3>

<p>10/10</p>

<p>Single best book on writing for business communication. I also read ‘On Writing Well’ but this tackles structure in a way that book doesn’t.</p>

<p>I found the 2nd or 3rd chapter hard to get through, but after that it was smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Inductive vs. Deductive was the single best chapter.</p>

<p>I will be revisiting this book in every serious piece of writing I do, it is that good.</p>

<h3 id="crucial-conversations">Crucial Conversations</h3>

<p>Best leadership book I have ever read.</p>

<h3 id="permission-to-feel">Permission to Feel</h3>

<p>10/10</p>

<p>I initially judged this book by the name and front cover, and didn’t read it. Big mistake.</p>

<p>This book could be called, “A Practical Guide to Emotional Intelligence”.</p>

<p>It walks through a system called RULER:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recognizing emotions in oneself and others</li>
  <li>Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions</li>
  <li>Labeling emotions with a nuanced vocabulary</li>
  <li>Expressing emotions in accordance with cultural norms and social context</li>
  <li>Regulating emotions with helpful strategies</li>
</ol>

<p>The U part, of Understanding, was what I found I was lacking the most. It is not just patience that is required, but the calm collected approach to navigate someone elses problem in a way you can peel back the layers of behaviour to reveal the root cause. Most people only look at the behaviour and respond to the symptoms, rather than the root cause behind it.</p>

<p>Labeling is also helpful in recognizing a light emotion and starting a Crucial Conversation about it, rather than waiting for it to escalate to a heavier emotion.</p>

<p>All ‘People Problems’ are P1, as they are so rare and can escalate in severity so quickly.</p>

<p>The Regulation chapter was useful for me to map language to what I was already trying to do, I just didn’t consciencely think of it as regulation.</p>

<p>9/10</p>

<p>I love the cover of this book! I’ve had all the papers fly out of my suitcase before, metaphorically.</p>

<p>“Executive presence”</p>

<p>My favorite part of</p>

<ul>
  <li>Breadth</li>
  <li>Depth</li>
  <li>Height</li>
  <li>Sight</li>
</ul>

<p>There was some weird stuff in here about dressing up, but just don’t read the appearance chapter.</p>

<p>SMART concept/system (style, message, arena, receiver and timing)</p>

<p>‘Availability bias’ set off a huge light bulb.</p>

<h3 id="many-communicate-few-connect">Many Communicate Few Connect</h3>

<p>Forming deeper and more personal connections with folks.</p>

<p>The classic. 113k Amazon reviews.</p>

  <li>Any books you recommend that I missed here?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A lot of these fall near the ‘self-improvement’ realm, there are hundreds of books on leadership, speaking, writing, emotional intelligence and similar topics.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion most of them must be bullshit, but these were the few I read, and none of them were.</p>
