    <p><a href="https://www.barbaraminto.com/textbook.html">The Minto Pyramid Principle Textbook</a> is helpful in writing. I figured I would write a post on how I wrote the other posts, mostly for myself in order to re-read this in the future and track differences in my writing approach over time.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-pyramid">Building a Pyramid</h2>

<p>The first few versions of the following posts were mostly me textually vomitting what I wanted to say, where I wanted to gather folks thoughts on the substance of my writing rather than the structure. I then refactored the posts to improve their structure, much like productionizing a Python script. E.g. Originally it was 1 big post – but then I refactored it into 3 parts, since if I was a security engineer sending this post to a colleague, I’d want 1 post per question and answer pair.</p>

<p>It would be better to start with structure, and then write what I had to say. Granted, the more I wrote, the more I discovered challenges and areas I needed to research more in-depth. So I would have needed to iterate either way.</p>

<p>Minto says, in Chapter 3, you can build the Pyramid from the top down, or bottom up.</p>

<h3 id="bottom-up">Bottom Up</h3>

<ol>
  <li>List all the points I want to make</li>
  <li>Work out the relationships between them</li>
  <li>Draw conclusions</li>
  <li>Work backwards to get the introduction</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="top-down">Top Down</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the subject</li>
  <li>Decide the question</li>
  <li>Give the answer</li>
  <li>Check the S and C will lead to the question</li>
  <li>Verify the Answer</li>
  <li>Move to fill in the Key Line</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-1-vpc">Part 1: VPC</h2>

<h3 id="list-of-points">List of Points</h3>

<p>At the highest level of abstraction, the points I want to make are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This post is just for services in a VPC</li>
  <li>1000 ft. view image shows What Good Looks Like</li>
  <li>Banning IGWs solves Internet exposures (Maybe the Answer?)</li>
  <li>Ingress/Egress is tightly coupled (A complication.)</li>
  <li>How do we support Egress use-case? (A question.)</li>
  <li>We have 4 different options (Sort of an answer too.)</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the various options, I have a point or two I would like to highlight, to shed more light on the option.</p>

<h3 id="relationships-between-points">Relationships between Points</h3>

<p>Minto says in Chapter 8, you can use a Problem Definition Framework in which R1 is “What don’t we like about the current situation?” and R2 is “What we want instead?”.</p>

<p>Once we have R1 and R2, the problem is defined. We look for the solution.</p>

<p>For “Part 1: VPC”, we require 2 layers:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AbGHXHo.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Minto says to move from left to right, and down. Hence the numbered purple arrows.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions-drawn">Conclusions Drawn</h3>
<h3 id="introduction-options">Introduction Options</h3>

<p>After describing What Good Looks Like (arrow #1)</p>

<h4 id="option-a">Option A</h4>

<p>I could ignore Minto’s advice, and go straight into:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason this is complicated to implement, is because in AWS: Egress to the Internet is tightly coupled with Ingress from the Internet. In most cases, only the former is required (for example, downloading libraries, patches, or OS updates).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason they are tightly coupled: is an Internet Gateway (IGW) is necessary for both. So if an engineer has IAM permissions to create an IGW, or is unrestrained in how they create resources in a VPC that has one, they can expose resources to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, I combine both layers of the problem-definition into one complication.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I would need to give the first solution (banning IGWs) in the introduction.</p>

<p>Then I can have the next section titled Preventing by Design and start it with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since an IGW is the root of all of our problems, we simply can ban their creation via SCP (“ec2:CreateInternetGateway”) upon vending an account, (alongside deleting all the IGWs/VPCs that AWS makes by default in new accounts.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full reproduction:</p>

  <p>The Egress use-case typical looks like:

  <p>Whereas an accidental Internet-exposure might look like:

<blockquote>
  <p>Or:     <br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gyXZz2E.gif" alt="alt text" /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are many ways to expose resources to the Internet like this, but the key insight – for VPCs at least – is that they all require an Internet Gateway (IGW).</p>

  <h2 id="preventing-by-design">Preventing by Design</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since an IGW is the root of all of our problems, we simply can ban their creation via SCP 
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ec2:CreateInternetGateway"</code>) upon vending an account, (alongside deleting all the IGWs/VPCs that AWS makes by default in new accounts.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s it. Problem solved! You can hand the subaccount over to the customer, they will never be able to make public-facing load balancers or EC2 instances regardless of their IAM permissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can then, put accounts that were vended this way with the IGW-deny-SCP, in an OU and achieve an AWS organization structure similar to <a href="#about-the-problem">What Good Looks Like</a> above.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what if you need to support the Egress use-case above?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then you need to ensure your network architecture tightly couples a NAT Gateway with an Internet Gateway, by e.g. giving subaccounts a paved path to a NAT Gateway in another account, you can do this via:</p>

<h3 id="picking-an-option">Picking an Option</h3>

<p>Pros for A:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No Solutions in the Introduction</li>
  <li>Solely paints a picture, and is About The Problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros for B:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The solution for the first layer of the problem definition is right next to What Good Looks Like</li>
  <li>Less words</li>
  <li>The next section is more granular</li>
  <li>The first section isn’t soley About The Problem IMO.</li>
  <li>More upfront</li>
